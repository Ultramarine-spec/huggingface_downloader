## Usage

Use the [Huggingface mirror](https://hf-mirror.com/) to download the dataset or model. Mirror websites occasionally experience unstable connections. Multiple attempts should resolve this.

Just modify your local path or model/dataset name according to model.sh/dataset.sh as needed.
```shell
bash model.sh/dataset.sh
```
